# Albums App

## Description of the app:
- Shows a list of albums title + thumbnail from https://static.leboncoin.fr/img/shared/technical-test.json
- Shows cached data from database on offline mode
- Must handle screen rotations
- Must load images with an "User-Agent" header

## Architecture, patterns and libraries choices:
- Clean architecture with multi-modules: we have several modules for core : app, domain, network, ui. 
Then we have several modules for the "album" feature : data-database, data-network and ui.
This app is simple so a multi-module architecture is a bit overkill, but it forces the code to be neatly separated in the right layer.
- Hilt for the dependency injection
- Coroutines and Flows for async tasks
- MVVM with a StateFlow that emits an UiState that represents the state of the UI.
- Compose for the UI, with a preview of each state.
- Room database
- Retrofit + Okhttp for the network requests
- Coil for loading images: we inject a custom ImageLoader in NetworkModule to set the "User-Agent" header in the requests 
- Unit testing with JUnit and Fakes (no mocks so itâ€™s faster)
- GetAlbumsUseCase contains the business logic of switching between the network data source and the database data source.
- Android testing of the AlbumsScreens and the MainNavigation

## Remarks
- Ideally the class CoroutinesTestRule should be in the core-app/testFixtures folder, but does not work :( https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-50667/Support-compiling-android-testFixtures-sources-in-the-kotlin-android-gradle-plugin
